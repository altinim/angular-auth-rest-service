Angular - 2nd week 

Today is the last day of the 2nd week of working with Angular  and here is a summary of what I have worked on today:

-Performance improvements:
I have updated the Angular task we had this weeek. Although the basic functions were already there, I gave them functional changes to have a better performance.

-Project Review:
I took a look at some of the small projects I did in the last 2 weeks that I have followed on different courses and the Angular documentation

-Error Handling:
I added  error handling for HTTP requests, ensuring that the website handles any error.

Cities data fetches from JSON format:
City data is now dynamically retrieved from JSON format.

-Landing page:
I came up with a welcoming homepage, and set the tone for a great user experience.

-Blur background effect
I added a cool background blur effect to sce things and give the project a more immersive feel.

-User Error:
Now input errors come with displays that are better, more visually appealing, and make it easier for users to understand whatâ€™s going on.
